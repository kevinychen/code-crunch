There are two elevators in Next house. During CPW, prefrosh will be wandering the halls of Next. At the end
of CPW, our job is to round them all up and send them home. To do this, we have the elevators pick up prefrosh, 
but never drop any (assume we have really BIG elevators). Don't worry, they'll be released at the end of the day.
However, you should worry about how to minimize total elevator movement because heavy elevators take a lot of energy to move.

You're given the schedule of floors that need to be reached. Only one elevator needs to be sent to a given floor for
a request. Print the minimum total floors that both elevators need to move. If an elevator is already there, you don't
need to do anything.

Both elevators start at floor 1. There are 5 floors in Next (??), numbered 1-5.
