As the semester winds down, you and your friends decide to play the most infamous game in Next House: Nerf Gun Roulette.
Surprisingly, there are Nerf revolvers with up to N chambers. Your friend loads come of the chambers, shows them to you
and then spins the barrel. He puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. Click. It was an empty chamber.

Now it's your turn, given the distribution of loaded chambers do you: 1) Shoot right away 2) Randomize again 3) Do either,
since your chances are the same.

The state of the chambers are given as a string, 0 for unloaded, 1 for loaded. Remember that your friend spun the revolver after
showing it to you, but didn't touch any further after pulling the trigger on himself. After the trigger is pulled, the next chamber to
the right is moved into place (or it wraps around).
