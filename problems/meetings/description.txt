Bob has a lot of meetings. He gets paid for each meeting that he goes to. Unfortunately, he can only
be in one place at any given time and needs to be present for an entire meeting. Except, he has permission to merge 
a pair of overlapping meetings while still getting paid for both meetings. What is the maximum number of meetings Bob can
attend?

For simplicity, pretend that time is represented by nonnegative integers.

Meetings are overlapping if the start of one meeting comes before the start of another meeting.
(1,2) and (2,4) are not overlapping.

Input Format:
N - number of meetings (< 100)
s_1 e_1 (integers, start time and end time, s_i < e_i)
s_2 e_2
...
s_N e_N

Output Format:
maximum number of meetings

Example:

Input:
5
1 7
3 8
9 12
6 18
15 19

Output:
