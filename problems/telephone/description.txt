You're given an old fashioned rotary telephone with the digits 0-9 plus a * in clockwise order, for 11 total symbols on the circular dialer. To dial a number, 
you put your finger on the number and rotate the wheel clockwise such that your finger is aligned with where the * used to be. Each piece of the rotation counts as 1 move.

Example phone with number 0-3:

  1 2
0     3
   *

Dialing 1301:

To dial 1 takes 3 moves.

To dial 3 takes 1 move.

To dial 0 takes 4 moves. 

Dialing 1 again takes 3 moves for a total of 11 moves.

However, if we move the * to a different spot:

  1 *
0     2
   3

The whole number now only takes 7 moves.

Now, given a phone with 0-9 and a phone numbers (string of digits), print the
minimum number of moves needed to dial the number with an optimal placement of *.

The length of the string will be less than 100 characters.

Input:

0001

Output:

5
