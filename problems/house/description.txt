There's no place like home. This applies to palindromes too! We all want to see homey palindromes, so
take the following string and convert it into a palindrome containing "house". You can replace
any letter, but try to minimize the number of replacements. If it's impossible, print "impossible".

Otherwise, print the homey palindrome and the number of replacements, separated by a space.

The string will be less than 100 characters long
